        <p><strong>Birth of a project</strong></p>
        <span class="underline"></span>
        <p>Bio-Banao was born in the creative crucible of Turing 210 at Chitkara University in 2024. It all started when Amanpreet, Lovepreet, and Jashan, while chilling in their favorite room, noticed a peculiar trend—friends who could code circles around them were stumped by something as simple as a resume and cover letter. Sensing a mix of opportunity and absurdity, the trio decided to take matters into their own hands. What began as a university project quickly turned into a mission: to turn boring bios into brilliant ones. And thus, Bio-Banao was born—crafted with just the right blend of professional polish and a wink of humor, making self-promotion feel as fun as it should be.</p>

                By combining their respective backgrounds in technology, marketing, and design, the three came up with the idea of an intuitive, web-based tool that would make it as simple as possible to produce an eye-catching resume.
